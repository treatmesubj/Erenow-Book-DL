# Erenow Book Downloader

I was enjoying a cigar and relistening to one of my favorite books: _The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt_, when I looked up one of Teddy's funnier quotes online and stumbled upon what seemed to be an entire chapter. It turned out that the site: https://erenow.net/, hosted the whole book as well as more than 1200 others! The webpages were a bit cluttered and there were ads, so I figured I'd write a script to just fetch the books, clean them up, and write 'em to my own custom HTML files.

Usage: `py teddy.py <book-url> [--dark]`

the optional `--dark` argument inverts colors so that the background is black and the text is white
